# Finance App - Refactored Structure

This is a refactored version of the Finance application with a clean, modular architecture.

## Project Structure

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
- **Models**: Separate classes for User, Portfolio, and Watchlist management
- **Routes**: Organized by functionality (auth, portfolio, quote, features)
- **Utils**: Reusable utility functions
- **Config**: Centralized configuration management

### 2. **Separation of Concerns**
- Database operations are encapsulated in model classes
- Route handlers focus on HTTP request/response logic
- Business logic is separated from presentation logic

### 3. **Better Code Organization**
- Related functionality is grouped together
- Easy to find and modify specific features
- Clear dependencies between modules

### 4. **Improved Maintainability**
- Each module has a single responsibility
- Easy to add new features or modify existing ones
- Better testability with isolated components

## How to Run

1. **Use the new application file**:
   ```bash
   python app_new.py
   ```

2. **Or run the original file** (for comparison):
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Module Descriptions

### Models
- **User**: Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management
- **Portfolio**: Manages stock holdings, transactions, and portfolio calculations
- **Watchlist**: Handles watchlist and price alert functionality

### Routes
- **auth.py**: Login, register, logout, and password change routes
- **portfolio.py**: Main portfolio view, buy/sell transactions, and history
- **quote.py**: Stock quote lookup functionality
- **features.py**: Watchlist management, price alerts, and transaction notes

### Utils
- **helpers.py**: Common utility functions (apology, login_required, usd formatting)
- **stock_utils.py**: Stock-related functions (lookup, sector info, popular stocks)

### Config
- **database.py**: Database initialization and session configuration

## Migration Notes

The refactored version maintains full compatibility with the original application:
- All routes and functionality remain the same
- Database schema is unchanged
- Templates and static files are reused
- Session management works identically

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without cluttering the main file
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation makes debugging and updates easier
3. **Reusability**: Models and utilities can be reused across different parts of the app
4. **Testing**: Each module can be tested independently
5. **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously

## Future Enhancements

With this structure, you can easily add:
- API endpoints for mobile apps
- Additional portfolio analysis features
- Real-time stock price updates
- Advanced user preferences
- Integration with external financial APIs
